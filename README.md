# HTML CANVAS

An HTML canvas program built with my nephew in mind.  Base MVP is a drawing tool used with click events of the mouse, but I expanded its' capabilities to include touchscreen functionality.  I had to adjust the way the program recognizes the position of the touch to make the responsiveness continuous.

# Development Map

Will next be adding an options tab to choose colors either from a set list or from a color wheel, as well as set line width.  Also add a big ERASE button.
