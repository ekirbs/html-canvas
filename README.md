# HTML CANVAS

An HTML canvas program built with my nephew in mind.  Base MVP is a drawing tool used with click events of the mouse, but I expanded its' capabilities to include touchscreen functionality.  I had to adjust the way the program recognizes the position of the touch to make the responsiveness continuous.

# Development Map

 - An options tab to choose colors either from a set list or from a color wheel, as well as set line width.
 - A big ERASE button.
 - A database and save function for pictures...
 - Need a proper readme soon too...

# Thanks

Special Thanks to Wes Bos and his JavaScript 30 series for the base program.
